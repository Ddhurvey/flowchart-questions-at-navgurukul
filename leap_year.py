# Imagine you and your friends are exploring the concept of leap years. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. In simpler terms, it's a special year with an extra day in February (February 29th). You're curious to know whether a particular year is a leap year or not.

# Write a program to take a year from the user and output whether a given year is a leap year or not.

# Note: A year is said to be a leap year if it is either divisible by 400 or it should be divisible by 4 and not by 100.

# Tips:

# 1. Remember, a leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
# 2. Pay attention to the conditions for determining a leap year.
# 3. Understand the significance of leap years in adjusting the calendar.

# Test Case1:
# Input:
# 1800
# Output:
# No

# Test Case2:
# Input:
# 2000
# Output:
# Yes

# Test Case3:
# Input:
# 2024
# Output:
# Yes

    print("yes ",year," is leap year.")
elif year%100==0:

else:
    print("NO ",year," is not a leap year.")
